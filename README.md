<!-- badges: end -->

**CMRnet** is an R package that helps construct social and movement
networks from spatio-temporally referenced capture-mark recapture data.

## Bugs and Suggestions

It is very difficult to develop a package that is robust to all types of
datasets and user requirements. But we want to help. Please report any
bugs or suggestions to the
[Issues](https://github.com/matthewsilk/CMRnet)

## Installation

**CMRnet** can be easily downloaded and installed from GitHub using
`remotes::install_github()`. The vignettes available with the package
can be downloaded by adding `build_vignettes = TRUE`.

``` r
# install CMRnet
remotes::install_github("matthewsilk/CMRnet")
```

## Getting started

  - For an introduction to using **CMRnet**, see `vignette("CMRnet")`
  - For a more detailed explanation of how data needs to be organised
    for use in **CMRnet** , the functionality of **CMRnet** and advice
    on the creation of networks and onward analysis and plotting, see
    `vignette("CMRnet_information")`
  - For case study 1 on the social behaviour of badgers over 30 years,
    see `vignette("CaseStudyOne")`
  - For case study 2 on the creation of multiplex movement networks in a
    high density badger population, see `vignette("CaseStudyTwo")`.
